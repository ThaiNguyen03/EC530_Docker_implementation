# EC530_Docker_implementation

This repository is used to demonstrate how to containerize an API based on the Login API of Project 2.

## Description
The Dockerfile and requirements.txt are provided to build the image. Run "docker build -t login-api" to build the image for the API. Run the Docker_test.py code to see if the container is running. The test code should output "Container is running" if the container can be run from the image.
